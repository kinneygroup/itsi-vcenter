### Services
VMware vCenter monitoring encompasses several specialized services, each targeting specific aspects of the environment:

1. vCenter Server
    * Description: The central management server for the entire VMware environment.

2. ESXi Hosts
    * Description: Physical servers running the hypervisor, hosting virtual machines.

3. Datastores
    * Description: Storage containers for VMs.

4. Virtual Machines (VMs)
    * Description: Individual virtualized systems running on ESXi hosts.

5. Network
    * Description: Virtual switches and physical network interfaces.


### KPIs
Each service utilizes specific KPIs to measure its effectiveness:

1. CPU Usage (ESXi Hosts)
    * Description: Monitor the CPU usage of ESXi hosts to ensure they are not overutilized or underutilized.

2. Memory Usage (ESXi Hosts)
    * Description: Track memory usage to prevent memory overcommitment and ensure optimal performance.

4. Network Latency (ESXi Hosts)
    * Description: Monitor network latency to ensure efficient communication between VMs and external systems.

5. Disk Latency (Datastores)
    * Description: Measure the latency of datastore disks to identify potential performance bottlenecks.

6. Datastore Capacity (Datastores)
    * Description: Keep an eye on the available capacity of datastores to prevent storage shortages.

7. CPU Usage (Virtual Machines)
    * Description: Monitor the CPU usage of VMs to ensure they are not overutilized or underutilized.

8. Memory Usage (Virtual Machines)
    * Description: Track memory usage to prevent memory overcommitment and ensure optimal performance.

9. Network Latency (Network)
    * Description: Monitor network latency to ensure efficient communication between VMs and external systems.

10. Network Throughput (Network)
    * Description: Measure the amount of data being transmitted through the network to ensure it meets performance requirements.


### Relationships
#### Dependencies:
Services are interconnected; for instance, the vCenter Server is dependent on ESXi Hosts and Datastores. Similarly, ESXi Hosts rely on the network for communication and on the vCenter Server for management.

#### Hierarchical Structure:
Some services form a hierarchy, such as ESXi Hosts depending on the vCenter Server, illustrating a layered approach to performance monitoring where base metrics support broader performance indicators.
